This is my Oracle PL/SQL (19c) and Java project where I will showcase my skillsets within SQL * Plus, SQL Developer, and Eclipse environments. I created the fictitious data presented and used it to present the following skillset components: Entity tables, supported by primary and foreign keys, a dynamic stored procedure, a function, a call to the function, AES 192 encryption, a DBMS_Scheduler, a package, a statistical data snapshot, and a call to the statistical data snapshot.
