My website is designed to represent my Oracle PL/SQL (19c) and Java (JDBC) project where I have showcased my skill sets within SQL * Plus, SQL Developer, and Eclipse environments. I created the fictitious data presented in each of my databases, Oracle 19c - GitHub Project and Hospital_DB, and used it to illustrate the following skill set components: Entity tables, primary and foreign keys, additional PL/SQL activities, and several Java and JDBC activities.
